/*
  Deep Sleep with External Wake Up
  =====================================
  This code displays how to use deep sleep with
  an external trigger as a wake up source and how
  to store data in RTC memory to use it over reboots

  This code is under Public Domain License.

  Hardware Connections
  ======================
  Push Button to GPIO 33 pulled down with a 10K Ohm
  resistor

  NOTE:
  ======
  Only RTC IO can be used as a source for external wake
  source. They are pins: 0,2,4,12-15,25-27,32-39.

    First we configure the wake up source
    We set our ESP32 to wake up for an external trigger.
    There are two types for ESP32, ext0 and ext1 .
    ext0 uses RTC_IO to wakeup thus requires RTC peripherals
    to be on while ext1 uses RTC Controller so doesnt need
    peripherals to be powered on.
    Note that using internal pullups/pulldowns also requires
    RTC peripherals to be turned on.
